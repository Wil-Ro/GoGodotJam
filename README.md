# GoGodotJam - A small game made over the course of a week for the w0ww GoGodot game jam
 
This untitled project is a small game based off the theme "Evolution", it's build in the open source "Godot" engine.

This is a small roguelike dungeon crawler where the player is forced to leave a percentage of the enemies alive and each levels enemies evolve and develop from the previous enemies that weren't killed. The idea was to force the player to think ahead and plan which enemies they spare in order to control the evolution system to give them future combantants that they can face without issue.

This project is code complete save for a few minor bugs, however it is greatly lacking in models and still uses mostly developer textures and empty levels.
